Sign Language Recognition with Action Recognition(LSTM)

An essential aspect of effective communication for the deaf and hard of hearing community is sign language. The increasing integration of technology into daily life has prompted the development of Sign Language Recognition (SLR) systems, aimed at bridging the communication gap between sign language users and non-signers. This study presents a novel SLR system specifically designed for American Sign Language (ASL) recognition, catering to the unique linguistic and gestural characteristics of ASL . The proposed ASL recognition system employs a multi-modal approach, combining computer vision and machine learning techniques.. The computer vision component processes video input, extracting meaningful features from the signer's hand movements, facial expressions, and body posture. These features are then fed into a machine learning framework, which employs state-of-the-art deep neural networks to classify and interpret the ASL gestures To enhance real-time performance, optimization techniques are employed to streamline computation while maintaining accuracy
